VALUES ("4", "Alex H.",  "3",  "Tried Crème Soda and while I appreciate the effort in the design and the concept of combining ice cream flavors with a sparkling beverage, it didn't completely win me over. The taste 
was good, but I expected a bit more wow factor. The package design is eye-catching, but I felt it could be toned down a bit. Giving it three stars for the creativity but hoping for some 
improvements in the future.");

VALUES ("8", "Jessica L.",  "3", "Tasted the Crème Soda in all three flavors. While the Mint Chocolate Chip and Caramel flavors were impressive, I found the Lemon flavor a bit too tangy 
for my liking. The package design is consistent across the flavors, capturing a fun and retro vibe. Giving it three stars overall, with a preference for the mint and caramel options.");
