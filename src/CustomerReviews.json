		"Review" : "Tried Crème Soda and while I appreciate the effort in the design and the concept of combining ice cream flavors with a sparkling beverage, it didn't completely win me over. The taste \nwas good, but I expected a bit more wow factor. The package design is eye-catching, but I felt it could be toned down a bit. Giving it three stars for the creativity but hoping for some \nimprovements in the future."

The package design is consistent across the flavors, capturing a fun and retro vibe. Giving it three stars overall, with a preference for the mint and caramel options."
